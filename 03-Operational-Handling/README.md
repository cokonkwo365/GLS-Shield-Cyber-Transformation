# 🛠️ Pillar 3: Operational Handling (GLS 500-User Baseline)

## Executive Summary
Establishing a consistent response workflow was vital to ensure that detected threats were triaged and mitigated efficiently. [cite_start]For the 500-user regional hub, the focus was on manual excellence and management visibility[cite: 9].

## Incident Lifecycle & Triage
[cite_start]I documented and implemented a standard triage process within the **Microsoft Defender Portal** to handle alerts generated by the Phase 1 detection logic[cite: 10].

### Triage Workflow:
1. **Initial Assessment:** Analysts evaluate alert severity and suppress known false positives (e.g., authorized VPN travel).
2. **Investigation:** Utilizing the "Investigation Graph" in Defender to identify affected entities (Users, Devices, Mailboxes).
3. **Containment:** Manual execution of response actions, such as "Isolate Device" or "Reset Password," directly from the incident page.
4. **Remediation & Closure:** Documenting root causes and closing incidents to maintain a clean SOC queue.

## Management Visibility: The "Single Pane of Glass"
[cite_start]To provide the GLS leadership team with real-time security insights, I deployed **Microsoft Sentinel Workbooks**[cite: 11].

### Key Reporting Metrics:
* **Incident Volume by Severity:** Monitoring trends in "High" vs. "Informational" alerts to ensure proper resource allocation.
* **Data Ingestion Health:** Tracking log flows from Entra ID and Defender to ensure no gaps in visibility.
* **Top Targeted Users:** Identifying frequent victims of phishing to trigger targeted security awareness training.

## Performance Validation
By standardizing these operational procedures, the regional hub is positioned to achieve a consistent Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA) under 15 minutes for critical incidents during the manual phase.
