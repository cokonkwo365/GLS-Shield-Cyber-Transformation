# 🛠️ Pillar 3: Operational Handling (GLS 500-User Baseline)

## Executive Summary
Establishing a consistent response workflow was vital to ensure that detected threats were triaged and mitigated efficiently. [cite_start]For the 500-user regional hub, the focus was on manual excellence and management visibility[cite: 9].

## Incident Lifecycle & Triage
[cite_start]I documented and implemented a standard triage process within the **Microsoft Defender Portal** to handle alerts generated by the Phase 1 detection logic[cite: 10].

### Triage Workflow:
1. **Initial Assessment:** Analysts evaluate alert severity and suppress known false positives (e.g., authorized VPN travel).
2. **Investigation:** Utilizing the "Investigation Graph" in Defender to identify affected entities (Users, Devices, Mailboxes).
3. **Containment:** Manual execution of response actions, such as "Isolate Device" or "Reset Password," directly from the incident page.
4. **Remediation & Closure:** Documenting root causes and closing incidents to maintain a clean SOC queue.

🕵️ Deep-Dive Analysis: Investigation Graph
To perform root-cause analysis, I utilized the Microsoft Defender Investigation Graph. This allowed me to visualize the relationship between compromised Entra ID accounts and affected regional endpoints, drastically reducing the time required to identify the scope of lateral movement within the 500-user hub.

## Technical Execution Steps:

1. **Incident Selection:** Navigate to Incidents & alerts > Incidents and select a high-priority alert (e.g., MFA Fatigue).
2. **Access Graph:** Click the Graph tab to view the visual attack story.
3. **Trace Entities:** Use the graph nodes to follow the path from the initial User compromise to the Regional Workstation and any subsequent File deletions.
4. **Confirm Blast Radius:** Identify if the threat moved to other accounts or devices to ensure a complete containment strategy, such as triggering an "Isolate Device" action.

## Management Visibility: The "Single Pane of Glass"
[cite_start]To provide the GLS leadership team with real-time security insights, I deployed **Microsoft Sentinel Workbooks**[cite: 11].

### Key Reporting Metrics:
* **Incident Volume by Severity:** Monitoring trends in "High" vs. "Informational" alerts to ensure proper resource allocation.
* **Data Ingestion Health:** Tracking log flows from Entra ID and Defender to ensure no gaps in visibility.
* **Top Targeted Users:** Identifying frequent victims of phishing to trigger targeted security awareness training.

## Performance Validation
By standardizing these operational procedures, the regional hub is positioned to achieve a consistent Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA) under 15 minutes for critical incidents during the manual phase.
